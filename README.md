Notebooks for the course 6CCM338 at King's College London

This repository contains the code used to produce the examples and figures used in the lecture notes for 6CCM338.

Students are not expected to know Python and I will not evaluate any coding skills in the exam.
This repository is for the students that have an interest in coding and would like to explore some of the concepts in the lectures a bit further.

In src/utils.py you will find the classes used for some of the simulations. In particular, you will find the classes RandomWalk, BrownianMotion, and GeometricBrownianMotion. 
In notebooks/ you will find all notebooks, ordered by Chapter (according to the lecture notes).
